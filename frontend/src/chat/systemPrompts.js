 * untrusted-data rules, the native tool-calling protocol, and the no-dash hard
 * rule are all server-owned: every request (both /api/chat/stream and the
 * built-in Beagle proxy) passes through enforceServerSystemBoundary +
 * appendFinalOutputConstraints in server/src/routes/chat/helpers.ts, so
 * repeating those rules here would only bloat the prompt and create drifting
 * contradictory copies. This file carries only what is genuinely client-local:
 * the persona and the depth directive for each effort level.
